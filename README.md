# Ambient-Exploration
This auto-generated music device, built using Beap modules in Max, includes key components such as a sequencer, oscillator, filter, ADSR envelope, and VCA. The sequencers serve as the primary note generators, each operating with its clock for subdivision. Additionally, the device features audio effects, including reverb, to enhance the sound.
